A process represents an instance of a running program, with its own memory space and resources. DevOps relies on effective process management for deploying, monitoring, and scaling applications across distributed environments. Understanding processes is essential for tasks like monitoring performance, ensuring resource efficiency, and orchestrating deployments using containerization technologies. Meanwhile, signals are software interrupts used in Unix-like systems to communicate with processes, such as requesting termination or handling specific events. DevOps leverages signals for process control, enabling actions like graceful shutdowns, application reloads, or responding to operational events. Together, processes and signals are foundational concepts in DevOps, facilitating efficient application lifecycle management and system operation in dynamic and scalable environments.
